# 425/825 Project Description

This repository serves as a shell and (eventually) reference for the course project(s).

This is my solution for the course projects.  As each new project comes due, I will push my solution here.

Feel free to use my solution as the starting point for the next project.

To compile, run: pyb

To run: ./run.sh examples/project1/ex1.bs

To test: ./test.sh project1
